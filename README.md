# Apfel

## Introduction

Apfel is simple parser for .strings (DotStrings) files written in Ruby. DotStrings files are used by Apple platforms for localization. Apfel reads DotStrings files, parses them for key-value pairs and comments.

Once in the form of a hash, the content of the DotStrings file can easily be
rebuilt as JSON, XML and RESX (with the help of Builder https://github.com/jimweirich/builder) and more!

## Use

To start using Apfel first require the gem
```Ruby
require 'apfel'
```

Next, pass Apfel the .strings file you want to parse:
```Ruby
parsed_file = Apfel.parse('path/to/file')
```

Once the file has been parsed, you can do many things with it:
```Ruby
# Turn it into a ruby hash (includes comments)
parsed_file.to_hash

# Turn it into json (includes comments)
parsed_file.to_json

# With either #to_hash or #to_json you can specify
# whether you want the comments included
parsed_file.to_hash(with_comments: false)

# Get all the keys as an array
parsed_file.keys

# Get all the values as an array
parsed_file.values

# Return an array of key-value hashes
parsed_file.key_values

# Return an array of key-comment hashes
parsed_file.comments

# Return an array of all the comments without their keys
parsed_file.comments(with_keys: false)
```
